# Linked List Practice

Your challenge, if you choose to accept, is to write to functions that handle
two operations. This challenge is mean to test your ability to handle unfamiliar
problems and how you go about them.

The tasks are in two folds:

The first is to write a function that sorts a linked list. For now, you can
choose not to worry about efficiency but if you do, that's a plus for you.
Most of the linked list logic has already been implemented and you can simply
use them if you want in your implementation. At the end of your solution, you
are expected to write a simple driver code that serves as a proof-of-concept for
all that you've done. There's no automated testing for these tasks for a good
reason.

The second is an upgrade of the first. You will write a function that merges two
sorted linked lists. The linked lists can be of varying sizes (number of nodes).
Your function should be able to handle all this.

You are expected to come up with the solution through whiteboarding and a
careful thought process. You should share your whiteboard and pseudocode at the
end of the tasks. Have fun working on this task, feel free to mention anything I
missed.

Everything you need is in the [header file](node.h).
