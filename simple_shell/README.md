# Simple Shell

This is developing and testing environment while on the ALX Simple Shell
Project. Everything I do is what will be in my final project with some
modification where necessary.

This shell implementation is a minimal version of the original `sh` (Bourne
Shell). The project is to help us build something useful with the knowledge we
have accumulated while learning the C language.

Everything here is my work. :-)
